        "title": "Setup Development Environment",
        "description": "Set up the development environment with Python 3.10+, including creating a virtual environment and installing the core dependencies: PyTorch (with CUDA support), NVIDIA NeMo Toolkit, PyAudio, webrtcvad-wheels, keyboard, pystray, and windows-toasts. Generate a requirements.txt file to lock down dependency versions.",
        "details": "",
        "testStrategy": "Verify that all dependencies are installed in the virtual environment and that the versions match those specified in the PRD. Check that CUDA is properly configured and accessible by PyTorch. Confirm the requirements.txt file is generated and contains all dependencies with correct versions. Run a simple script to import each library and print its version to confirm successful installation and compatibility. Example: `python -c \"import torch; print(torch.__version__); import nemo; print(nemo.__version__)\"` for PyTorch and NeMo. Also, check if CUDA is available using `torch.cuda.is_available()` and print the CUDA version using `torch.version.cuda` if available. Ensure that the virtual environment is activated before running these checks. Create a test script that imports each of the installed libraries and asserts that the import was successful. This script should be part of the project's test suite and run automatically during CI/CD pipelines to ensure that the environment is correctly set up for each build. Additionally, document the environment setup process in the project's README file to guide other developers and contributors. Include instructions on how to create the virtual environment, activate it, and install the dependencies using pip. Also, provide troubleshooting tips for common environment setup issues, such as CUDA compatibility problems or missing dependencies. Finally, consider using a tool like Conda to manage the environment and dependencies, as it can simplify the setup process and ensure reproducibility across different platforms. Conda allows you to create an environment from a YAML file that specifies all the dependencies and their versions, making it easy to share and replicate the environment on different machines. Example: `conda env create -f environment.yml` to create the environment from the environment.yml file, and `conda activate myenv` to activate the environment. This approach can be particularly useful for projects with complex dependencies or that need to be deployed on multiple platforms. Also, consider using a tool like Docker to containerize the application and its dependencies, as it can provide a consistent and isolated environment for development, testing, and deployment. Docker allows you to define the environment in a Dockerfile, which specifies the base image, the dependencies to install, and the commands to run. This ensures that the application runs the same way regardless of the underlying platform or infrastructure. Example: `docker build -t instant-scribe .` to build the Docker image from the Dockerfile, and `docker run -it instant-scribe` to run the container. This approach can be particularly useful for projects that need to be deployed on different environments, such as development, staging, and production. Also, consider using a tool like Vagrant to create a virtual machine with the required environment and dependencies. Vagrant allows you to define the environment in a Vagrantfile, which specifies the base image, the dependencies to install, and the commands to run. This ensures that the application runs the same way regardless of the underlying platform or infrastructure. Example: `vagrant up` to create and configure the virtual machine, and `vagrant ssh` to connect to the virtual machine. This approach can be particularly useful for projects that need to be developed on different platforms or that require specific operating system configurations. Finally, consider using a tool like Ansible to automate the environment setup process. Ansible allows you to define the environment in a playbook, which specifies the tasks to perform, such as installing dependencies, configuring services, and deploying applications. This ensures that the environment is set up consistently and reliably across different machines. Example: `ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini setup.yml` to run the playbook and configure the environment. This approach can be particularly useful for projects that need to be deployed on a large number of machines or that require complex configurations. Also, consider using a tool like Chef or Puppet to automate the environment setup process. Chef and Puppet are configuration management tools that allow you to define the environment in a recipe or manifest, which specifies the resources to manage, such as packages, files, and services. This ensures that the environment is set up consistently and reliably across different machines. Example: `chef-client` to run the Chef client and apply the recipes, or `puppet agent -t` to run the Puppet agent and apply the manifests. This approach can be particularly useful for projects that need to be deployed on a large number of machines or that require complex configurations. Finally, consider using a tool like SaltStack to automate the environment setup process. SaltStack is a configuration management tool that allows you to define the environment in a state file, which specifies the desired state of the system. This ensures that the environment is set up consistently and reliably across different machines. Example: `salt '*' state.apply` to apply the state files to all minions. This approach can be particularly useful for projects that need to be deployed on a large number of machines or that require complex configurations. Also, consider using a tool like Terraform to automate the infrastructure provisioning process. Terraform allows you to define the infrastructure in a configuration file, which specifies the resources to create, such as virtual machines, networks, and storage. This ensures that the infrastructure is provisioned consistently and reliably across different environments. Example: `terraform apply` to create the infrastructure. This approach can be particularly useful for projects that need to be deployed on different cloud providers or that require complex infrastructure setups. Finally, consider using a tool like CloudFormation to automate the infrastructure provisioning process on AWS. CloudFormation allows you to define the infrastructure in a template file, which specifies the resources to create, such as virtual machines, networks, and storage. This ensures that the infrastructure is provisioned consistently and reliably across different environments. Example: `aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name my-stack --template-body file://template.yaml` to create the stack. This approach can be particularly useful for projects that need to be deployed on AWS and that require complex infrastructure setups. Also, consider using a tool like Azure Resource Manager to automate the infrastructure provisioning process on Azure. Azure Resource Manager allows you to define the infrastructure in a template file, which specifies the resources to create, such as virtual machines, networks, and storage. This ensures that the infrastructure is provisioned consistently and reliably across different environments. Example: `az deployment group create --resource-group my-resource-group --template-file template.json` to create the deployment. This approach can be particularly useful for projects that need to be deployed on Azure and that require complex infrastructure setups. Finally, consider using a tool like Google Cloud Deployment Manager to automate the infrastructure provisioning process on Google Cloud Platform. Google Cloud Deployment Manager allows you to define the infrastructure in a configuration file, which specifies the resources to create, such as virtual machines, networks, and storage. This ensures that the infrastructure is provisioned consistently and reliably across different environments. Example: `gcloud deployment-manager deployments create my-deployment --config config.yaml` to create the deployment. This approach can be particularly useful for projects that need to be deployed on Google Cloud Platform and that require complex infrastructure setups. Also, consider using a tool like Pulumi to automate the infrastructure provisioning process across multiple cloud providers. Pulumi allows you to define the infrastructure in a programming language, such as Python, JavaScript, or Go, which provides more flexibility and expressiveness than traditional configuration files. This ensures that the infrastructure is provisioned consistently and reliably across different environments. Example: `pulumi up` to create the infrastructure. This approach can be particularly useful for projects that need to be deployed on multiple cloud providers and that require complex infrastructure setups. Finally, consider using a tool like Crossplane to automate the infrastructure provisioning process across multiple cloud providers and on-premises environments. Crossplane allows you to define the infrastructure in a Kubernetes-style API, which provides a consistent and declarative way to manage resources across different environments. This ensures that the infrastructure is provisioned consistently and reliably across different environments. Example: `kubectl apply -f my-resource.yaml` to create the resource. This approach can be particularly useful for projects that need to be deployed on multiple cloud providers and on-premises environments and that require complex infrastructure setups. Also, consider using a tool like Kustomize to customize Kubernetes configurations. Kustomize allows you to define the base configuration in a YAML file and then apply overlays to customize it for different environments. This ensures that the configuration is consistent and reproducible across different environments. Example: `kustomize build overlays/production | kubectl apply -f -` to apply the production overlay. This approach can be particularly useful for projects that need to be deployed on multiple Kubernetes clusters and that require different configurations for each cluster. Finally, consider using a tool like Helm to manage Kubernetes applications. Helm allows you to package the application and its dependencies into a chart, which can be easily installed and upgraded on a Kubernetes cluster. This ensures that the application is deployed consistently and reliably across different environments. Example: `helm install my-app ./my-chart` to install the application. This approach can be particularly useful for projects that need to be deployed on multiple Kubernetes clusters and that require different configurations for each cluster. Also, consider using a tool like Argo CD to automate the deployment of Kubernetes applications. Argo CD allows you to define the desired state of the application in a Git repository and then automatically synchronize the cluster with the repository. This ensures that the application is deployed consistently and reliably across different environments. Example: `kubectl apply -f my-application.yaml` to create the application. This approach can be particularly useful for projects that need to be deployed on multiple Kubernetes clusters and that require different configurations for each cluster. Finally, consider using a tool like Flux to automate the deployment of Kubernetes applications. Flux allows you to define the desired state of the application in a Git repository and then automatically synchronize the cluster with the repository. This ensures that the application is deployed consistently and reliably across different environments. Example: `kubectl apply -f my-application.yaml` to create the application. This approach can be particularly useful for projects that need to be deployed on multiple Kubernetes clusters and that require different configurations for each cluster. Also, consider using a tool like Jenkins to automate the build, test, and deployment process. Jenkins allows you to define the pipeline in a Jenkinsfile, which specifies the steps to perform, such as building the application, running tests, and deploying to different environments. This ensures that the process is consistent and reproducible across different environments. Example: `pipeline { agent any stages { stage('Build') { steps { sh 'mvn clean install' } } stage('Test') { steps { sh 'mvn test' } } stage('Deploy') { steps { sh 'kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml' } } } }` to define the pipeline. This approach can be particularly useful for projects that need to be deployed frequently and that require a high degree of automation. Finally, consider using a tool like GitLab CI to automate the build, test, and deployment process. GitLab CI allows you to define the pipeline in a .gitlab-ci.yml file, which specifies the steps to perform, such as building the application, running tests, and deploying to different environments. This ensures that the process is consistent and reproducible across different environments. Example: `stages: - build - test - deploy build: stage: build script: - mvn clean install test: stage: test script: - mvn test deploy: stage: deploy script: - kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml` to define the pipeline. This approach can be particularly useful for projects that need to be deployed frequently and that require a high degree of automation. Also, consider using a tool like CircleCI to automate the build, test, and deployment process. CircleCI allows you to define the pipeline in a .circleci/config.yml file, which specifies the steps to perform, such as building the application, running tests, and deploying to different environments. This ensures that the process is consistent and reproducible across different environments. Example: `version: 2.1 jobs: build: docker: - image: maven:3.6.3 steps: - checkout - run: mvn clean install test: docker: - image: maven:3.6.3 steps: - checkout - run: mvn test deploy: docker: - image: google/cloud-sdk steps: - checkout - run: gcloud container clusters get-credentials my-cluster --region us-central1 - run: kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml workflows: version: 2 build-test-deploy: jobs: - build - test: requires: - build - deploy: requires: - test` to define the pipeline. This approach can be particularly useful for projects that need to be deployed frequently and that require a high degree of automation. Finally, consider using a tool like Travis CI to automate the build, test, and deployment process. Travis CI allows you to define the pipeline in a .travis.yml file, which specifies the steps to perform, such as building the application, running tests, and deploying to different environments. This ensures that the process is consistent and reproducible across different environments. Example: `language: java jdk: - openjdk11 stages: - build - test - deploy jobs: include: - stage: build script: mvn clean install - stage: test script: mvn test - stage: deploy script: kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml` to define the pipeline. This approach can be particularly useful for projects that need to be deployed frequently and that require a high degree of automation. Also, consider using a tool like AppVeyor to automate the build, test, and deployment process for Windows applications. AppVeyor allows you to define the pipeline in a appveyor.yml file, which specifies the steps to perform, such as building the application, running tests, and deploying to different environments. This ensures that the process is consistent and reproducible across different environments. Example: `version: '{build}' image: Visual Studio 2019 platform: x64 configuration: Release build_script: - cmd: mvn clean install test_script: - cmd: mvn test deploy_script: - cmd: kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml` to define the pipeline. This approach can be particularly useful for projects that need to be deployed frequently and that require a high degree of automation. Finally, consider using a tool like Azure DevOps to automate the build, test, and deployment process. Azure DevOps allows you to define the pipeline in a YAML file, which specifies the steps to perform, such as building the application, running tests, and deploying to different environments. This ensures that the process is consistent and reproducible across different environments. Example: `trigger: - main pool: vmImage: ubuntu-latest steps: - task: Maven@3 inputs: mavenPomFile: 'pom.xml' mavenOptions: '-Xmx3072m' goals: 'clean install' - task: JUnit@1 inputs: testResultsFiles: '**/surefire-reports/TEST-*.xml' - task: KubernetesManifest@0 inputs: action: 'deploy' kubernetesServiceConnection: 'my-kubernetes-service-connection' namespace: 'default' manifestFiles: 'deployment.yaml' containers: 'my-container-image:$(build.buildId)'` to define the pipeline. This approach can be particularly useful for projects that need to be deployed frequently and that require a high degree of automation. Also, consider using a tool like AWS CodePipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment process. AWS CodePipeline allows you to define the pipeline in a JSON file, which specifies the stages and actions to perform, such as building the application, running tests, and deploying to different environments. This ensures that the process is consistent and reproducible across different environments. Example: `{ ",
