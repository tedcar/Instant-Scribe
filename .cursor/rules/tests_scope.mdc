- **Write tests at the task level, not the sub-task level**
  - A *whole task* corresponds to an H2 section in `Progress/DEV_TASKS.md` (e.g. "Logging & Configuration Framework").
  - Do **not** create separate test files for sub-tasks like `2.1` or `2.2`; cover their behaviour in a single test module for Task 2 as a whole.

- **Why**
  - Reduces test churn when subtasks evolve or are re-ordered.
  - Keeps CI fast by avoiding overly granular suites.

- **Implementation guidance**
  - Group related assertions within the same `tests/test_<task_slug>.py` file.
  - Use descriptive docstrings to map tests back to the DEV_TASKS numbering.

- **Environment immutability reminder**
  - Tests **must not** install or upgrade packages, modify global environment variables, or depend on system state changes.
