- **What is `InstanceScrubber`?**
  - The single top-level Python package that contains *all* production code for the Instant Scribe application.
  - Think of it as the "src/" directory in other projects.

- **Why keep it?**
  1. Packaging – PyPI wheel and PyInstaller builds require a canonical package root.
  2. Import hygiene – avoids clashes with third-party modules and keeps `import` statements predictable.
  3. Cursor rule `folder_structure.mdc` depends on its existence; deleting/renaming breaks CI.

- **DO NOT**
  - Delete or move this folder.
  - Scatter new production modules outside it (see folder_structure rule).

- **Allowed sub-folders** (examples):
  - `InstanceScrubber/audio/` – audio capture helpers
  - `InstanceScrubber/ipc/` – inter-process communication
  - `InstanceScrubber/ui/` – tray UI components

- **Non-production code** (tests, scripts, docs) belongs **outside** `InstanceScrubber/`.
