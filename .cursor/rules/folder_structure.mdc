- **Production code must reside in `InstanceScrubber/`**
  - Any `.py` file outside `InstanceScrubber/` (excluding `tests/`, `scripts/`, or tooling) is a rule violation.
  - Sub-packages are permitted, e.g. `InstanceScrubber/audio/`.
  - Rationale: keeps import paths predictable and supports single-point packaging.

- **Exceptions**
  - Entry-point launcher scripts inside `scripts/`.
  - Cursor rule files and generated stubs.

- **Examples**
  ```python
  # ✅ Valid – located in core package
  InstanceScrubber/config_manager.py

  # ❌ Invalid – top-level helper leaks out of package
  stray_util.py  # must be moved into InstanceScrubber/ or deleted
  ```
