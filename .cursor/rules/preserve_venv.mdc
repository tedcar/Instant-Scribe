- **Never rebuild, delete or modify the `.venv` directory**
  - The current virtual-environment is considered the **source of truth** for library versions.
  - Do **not** rerun `scripts/setup_env.ps1`, `pip install`, `pip-compile`, or any similar commands **unless the user explicitly instructs so.**

- **Preserve existing Python/CUDA libraries**
  - No upgrades/downgrades of PyTorch, NumPy, CUDA-toolkit, etc.
  - If a task seems to require a new library, *ask the user first*.

- **Allowed actions**
  - Downloading or updating model weights (e.g., Parakeet STT checkpoints) located outside `.venv`.
  - Running application code that merely *uses* the installed libraries.

- **Example – allowed**
  ```powershell
  # Pull updated Parakeet model
  python download_model.py --refresh
  ```

- **Example – forbidden**
  ```powershell
  # ❌ would violate the rule
  pip install --upgrade torch
  rm -r .venv && scripts/setup_env.ps1
  ```
