Instant Scribe: A Comprehensive Blueprint for a Lifelong Speech-to-Text Application on Windows 10


Part I: Foundational Architecture and Technology Stack

This document provides a complete and exhaustive technical blueprint for the development of "Instant Scribe," a highly robust, minimalist, and lifelong speech-to-text (STT) application designed exclusively for the Windows 10 operating system. It is intended to serve as the single source of truth for the development team, eliminating ambiguity and providing a step-by-step guide from architecture to deployment.

1.1. Core Principles and Design Philosophy

The architecture and implementation of Instant Scribe are guided by a set of foundational principles. These principles inform every technical decision and are paramount to achieving the project's objectives.
Minimalism by Default: The application's fundamental operational state is dormancy. It will reside in the system tray, consuming near-zero CPU, RAM, and GPU resources until explicitly activated by user command. This principle is the cornerstone of the "lifelong" operational goal, ensuring the application can run perpetually without degrading system performance. The transcription engine, being the most resource-intensive component, will only be engaged when speech is actively detected.
Robustness through Modularity: Each core function—audio capture, voice activity detection (VAD), transcription, and user interface—is encapsulated in a separate, well-defined software module. This modular architecture isolates potential points of failure. For instance, a crash within the AI model's process will not terminate the entire application, allowing for graceful recovery. This design simplifies development, debugging, and long-term maintenance.
Local-First and Offline Operation: All processing, including the computationally intensive STT inference, occurs entirely on the local machine. This design choice guarantees user privacy, eliminates cloud-related subscription costs and network latency, and ensures the application remains fully functional without an internet connection.1 This aligns with the goal of creating a self-contained, reliable tool.
User-Centric Control: The end-user must have clear, immediate, and unambiguous control over the application's primary states (e.g., listening, transcribing, idle). This control is provided through two distinct mechanisms: a global hotkey for rapid activation and a comprehensive system tray icon menu for more detailed interaction and status monitoring.

1.2. System Architecture Overview

The application is designed as a multi-threaded, multi-process system to ensure responsiveness and resilience. The architecture isolates resource-intensive tasks from the main user interface thread, preventing the application from becoming unresponsive during transcription and protecting it from model-related crashes.
The high-level architecture consists of the following interconnected components:
Main Application Process & Thread: This is the central coordinator. It is responsible for initializing all other components, managing the application's global state (e.g., is_listening, is_transcribing), and hosting the pystray system tray icon and its context menu. It serves as the parent process and orchestrator.
Audio Listener Thread: A dedicated thread responsible for continuously capturing audio from the default microphone device using the PyAudio library. It reads audio in small chunks and places them into a shared queue for the VAD processor. This runs in a non-blocking fashion to ensure the main application remains responsive.
Voice Activity Detection (VAD) Processor: This component runs within the Audio Listener Thread. It consumes audio chunks from the microphone stream and uses the lightweight webrtcvad library to classify each chunk as speech or silence in real-time. It implements a state machine to buffer contiguous speech segments and determines when a complete utterance has been captured. This "VAD Gate" is the key to the application's minimalist footprint, ensuring the GPU-heavy ASR model is only invoked for actual speech.
Transcription Worker Process: To achieve maximum robustness, the NVIDIA Parakeet model and the NeMo toolkit are loaded and run in a separate, dedicated worker process. This process isolation ensures that any potential CUDA errors or model crashes are contained and do not terminate the main application. The worker process waits for complete speech segments to be placed in an input queue by the VAD processor, performs transcription, and returns the resulting text to the main process via an output queue.
Hotkey Listener Thread: Managed by the keyboard library, this thread runs globally in the background, listening for a user-configurable key combination. Upon detection, it toggles the application's listening state, providing an instant, system-wide control mechanism.
Notification Manager: A simple module that interfaces with the Windows Notification Service via the windows-toasts library. It is used to provide non-intrusive feedback to the user, such as displaying the final transcribed text in a toast notification.
Configuration Manager: A utility class responsible for loading user settings from a persistent config.json file upon startup and saving any changes made during the application's runtime.

Part II: The Core Transcription Engine: Implementation with NVIDIA Parakeet

This section provides a detailed guide to implementing the heart of the application: the transcription engine powered by the NVIDIA Parakeet model. It covers the environment setup, a deep dive into the model's characteristics, and the implementation of a persistent, robust transcription service.

2.1. Environment Setup for NeMo and CUDA on Windows 10

A correct and stable environment is critical for the application's performance. The setup process must include verification of system prerequisites.

2.1.1. Prerequisite Verification

The application's installer or a first-run setup script must programmatically verify the presence of a compatible NVIDIA driver and CUDA environment.
NVIDIA Driver Check:
The NVIDIA System Management Interface (nvidia-smi) command-line tool is the most reliable way to check for the driver. The application can execute this command using Python's subprocess module and parse its output.

Python


# file: system_check.py
import subprocess
import logging

def get_nvidia_driver_version():
    """Checks for the NVIDIA driver version using nvidia-smi."""
    try:
        # Execute nvidia-smi command to get the driver version
        output = subprocess.check_output(
            ["nvidia-smi", "--query-gpu=driver_version", "--format=csv,noheader"],
            encoding='utf-8'
        )
        version = output.strip()
        logging.info(f"NVIDIA Driver Version detected: {version}")
        return version
    except (subprocess.CalledProcessError, FileNotFoundError):
        logging.error("nvidia-smi command not found or failed. NVIDIA driver may not be installed.")
        return None


CUDA Version Check:
While nvidia-smi reports the maximum CUDA version the driver supports, the most crucial check is the version that PyTorch was compiled against and can utilize. This can be verified directly within Python.

Python


# file: system_check.py
import torch

def get_pytorch_cuda_version():
    """Checks for the CUDA version PyTorch is using."""
    if torch.cuda.is_available():
        version = torch.version.cuda
        logging.info(f"PyTorch is using CUDA version: {version}")
        return version
    else:
        logging.error("PyTorch reports CUDA is not available.")
        return None


If these checks fail, the application must display a user-friendly message guiding them to the official NVIDIA driver download page. Research confirms there is no officially supported API to programmatically generate a direct download link for a specific GPU driver; therefore, manual user guidance is the only robust approach.26

2.1.2. Python Environment and Dependencies

The application will be developed using Python 3.10 or a later stable version. A dedicated virtual environment is mandatory to isolate dependencies.
Setup Commands:
Create the virtual environment:
python -m venv.venv
Activate the environment:
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies. The version of CUDA in the PyTorch installation command (cu118 in the example) must be chosen based on the target system's capabilities. The installer should ideally detect this and select the appropriate package.
Bash
# Install PyTorch with CUDA 11.8 support
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

# Install the NeMo ASR toolkit
pip install -U nemo_toolkit[asr]==1.23.0

# Install other core dependencies
pip install pyaudio==0.2.14 webrtcvad-wheels==2.0.14 keyboard==0.13.5 pystray==0.19.0 windows-toasts==1.3.1


A final requirements.txt file must be generated using pip freeze > requirements.txt to lock down all dependency versions for reproducible builds.28

2.2. The Parakeet TDT 0.6B-v2 Model: A Deep Dive

The choice of the nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2 model is central to this project's success. Its unique combination of accuracy, speed, and efficiency makes it superior to many larger, more resource-intensive models for a desktop application context.

2.2.1. Architectural and Performance Analysis

The model is built on the FastConformer-TDT architecture. The FastConformer encoder is known for its computational efficiency, while the Token and Duration Transducer (TDT) decoder jointly predicts tokens and their durations, which contributes to its high accuracy and the ability to generate precise timestamps.4 This architecture, combined with a full attention mechanism, allows it to process long audio segments (up to 24 minutes) in a single pass, making it robust for transcribing extended speech without manual chunking.4
The model's performance metrics establish it as a state-of-the-art open-source ASR solution:
Accuracy: It achieves a Word Error Rate (WER) of 6.05% on the Hugging Face Open ASR Leaderboard, outperforming models with nearly three times the parameters, such as OpenAI's Whisper-large-v3.3
Speed: On high-end hardware like an NVIDIA A100 GPU, it boasts a Real-Time Factor (RTFx) of approximately 3380, meaning it can process audio 3380 times faster than its actual duration. This translates to transcribing an hour of audio in just over one second.5
Robustness: The model demonstrates strong resilience to noise. In tests with a challenging Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of 5 dB, the WER only increases to 8.39%, showcasing its viability for real-world environments like busy offices or public spaces.4
Features: It natively supports automatic punctuation, capitalization, and the transcription of complex content like spoken numbers and even song lyrics.1

2.2.2. Resource Footprint and Hardware Requirements

For a "lifelong" application, understanding and managing the resource footprint is critical.
VRAM Consumption: Official NVIDIA documentation states a minimum VRAM requirement of just 2.1 GB to load the model.30 However, practical user reports and benchmarks indicate an average consumption closer to
3 GB during active inference.31 For robust planning, the application must be designed to accommodate the higher 3 GB figure.
Hardware Compatibility: The model is optimized for NVIDIA GPUs with Ampere, Blackwell, Hopper, or Volta architectures.4 While it delivers exceptional performance on data center cards like the A100, it has been successfully benchmarked on consumer-grade hardware, including mid-range laptop GPUs like the
NVIDIA RTX 3050.1 This broad compatibility is crucial for a general-purpose Windows application.
The following table summarizes the key performance and hardware characteristics of the Parakeet model.

2.3. Implementing the Transcription Service

The transcription service will be encapsulated within a dedicated worker process to ensure application stability.

2.3.1. Model Loading and VRAM Residency Strategy

To provide a responsive user experience, the significant latency of loading the 600M parameter model into VRAM must be incurred only once at application startup.
The model will be loaded using the from_pretrained class method from the NeMo toolkit, which automatically downloads the model from the Hugging Face Hub and caches it locally. This asr_model object will be maintained in the memory of the worker process for the application's entire lifecycle.

Python


# file: transcription_worker.py
import nemo.collections.asr as nemo_asr
import logging

class TranscriptionEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = None

    def load_model(self):
        """Loads the Parakeet model into VRAM. Should be called once on startup."""
        try:
            logging.info("Loading NVIDIA Parakeet TDT 0.6B-v2 model...")
            # This will download the model on first run and load it into GPU memory.
            self.model = nemo_asr.models.ASRModel.from_pretrained(
                model_name="nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2"
            )
            logging.info("Model loaded successfully.")
            # Warm-up run can reduce latency of the first real transcription
            self.model.transcribe(paths2audio_files=['path/to/a/short/silent/audio.wav'])
            logging.info("Model warmed up.")
        except Exception as e:
            logging.critical(f"Failed to load ASR model: {e}")
            self.model = None
            # Propagate failure to the main process to handle shutdown
            raise

    #... transcription methods will go here...



2.3.2. The Inference Pipeline and Output Handling

The core function of the worker is to receive raw audio data and return transcribed text. The design must accommodate both minimalist (text-only) and detailed (text with timestamps) outputs. This is achieved by leveraging different parameters and return types of the transcribe method.
The default usage of asr_model.transcribe() returns a simple list of transcribed strings, which is the most efficient method as it avoids the computational overhead of generating detailed alignment information.32 For more advanced use cases, passing
return_hypotheses=True provides a richer output object containing word-level timestamps, which can be parsed.8
This leads to a design with two distinct transcription methods within the TranscriptionEngine class:

Python


# file: transcription_worker.py (continued within TranscriptionEngine class)

def get_plain_transcription(self, audio_numpy_array):
    """
    Performs transcription and returns only the final text string.
    This is the most minimalist and efficient method.
    """
    if not self.model:
        logging.error("Transcription attempted but model is not loaded.")
        return ""
    try:
        # Input audio must be a 16kHz mono NumPy array.
        # The transcribe method handles batching, so we pass a list.
        transcriptions = self.model.transcribe(
            audio=[audio_numpy_array],
            batch_size=1
        )
        # For a single audio input, the result is the first element of the list.
        return transcriptions if transcriptions else ""
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"An error occurred during plain transcription: {e}")
        return ""

def get_detailed_transcription(self, audio_numpy_array):
    """
    Performs transcription and returns text along with word-level timestamps.
    """
    if not self.model:
        logging.error("Detailed transcription attempted but model is not loaded.")
        return "",
    try:
        # The timestamps=True flag enables word-level timestamp generation.
        hypotheses = self.model.transcribe(
            audio=[audio_numpy_array],
            batch_size=1,
            timestamps=True
        )

        if not hypotheses:
            return "", []

        # The output is a list of hypotheses, we take the first one.
        best_hypothesis = hypotheses[0]
        text = best_hypothesis.text
        
        # Extract word-level timestamps if available
        word_timestamps = []
        if best_hypothesis.timestamp and 'word' in best_hypothesis.timestamp:
            word_timestamps = best_hypothesis.timestamp['word']
        
        return text, word_timestamps
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"An error occurred during detailed transcription: {e}")
        return "", []



This dual-method approach allows the application to default to the most efficient mode while retaining the capability for more feature-rich output, directly addressing the core principles of minimalism and user-centric design.

Part III: Application Logic and System Integration

This section details the implementation of the application's core logic, connecting the audio input, user controls, and the transcription engine into a cohesive, responsive system.

3.1. Real-Time Audio Capture and VAD: The "Minimalist" Loop

The foundation of the application's "minimalist" principle is its ability to listen for speech without consuming significant resources. This is achieved through a carefully orchestrated real-time audio capture and Voice Activity Detection (VAD) loop.

3.1.1. Microphone Input with PyAudio

A dedicated thread will be established to handle all microphone input, preventing any I/O blocking on the main application thread. The PyAudio library provides the necessary interface to the Windows audio subsystem.11
The audio stream must be configured with parameters that are compatible with both the VAD library and the Parakeet ASR model:
Sample Rate: 16000 Hz, as required by the Parakeet model.4
Channels: 1 (mono), as required by the Parakeet model.4
Format: pyaudio.paInt16, representing 16-bit PCM audio, which is the format expected by webrtcvad.13
Chunk Size: The number of frames per buffer must align with the frame duration supported by webrtcvad (10, 20, or 30 ms). For a 30 ms frame duration at 16000 Hz, the chunk size is 16000×0.030=480 frames.
The following code demonstrates the initialization of such a stream:

Python


# file: audio_listener.py
import pyaudio
import logging

class AudioStreamer:
    def __init__(self, rate=16000, frame_duration_ms=30):
        self.rate = rate
        self.channels = 1
        self.format = pyaudio.paInt16
        self.chunk_size = int(self.rate * frame_duration_ms / 1000)
        
        self._p = pyaudio.PyAudio()
        self._stream = None

    def start_stream(self, callback):
        """Starts the audio stream and calls the callback with each chunk of audio data."""
        logging.info("Starting audio stream...")
        self._stream = self._p.open(
            format=self.format,
            channels=self.channels,
            rate=self.rate,
            input=True,
            frames_per_buffer=self.chunk_size,
            stream_callback=callback
        )
        self._stream.start_stream()

    def stop_stream(self):
        """Stops the audio stream."""
        if self._stream and self._stream.is_active():
            self._stream.stop_stream()
            self._stream.close()
            logging.info("Audio stream stopped.")
        self._p.terminate()



3.1.2. Implementing the VAD Gate with webrtcvad

The "VAD Gate" is the critical component that decides when to buffer audio for transcription. It runs within the audio listener's callback, analyzing each incoming chunk of audio from PyAudio. The webrtcvad library is ideal for this task due to its speed and low resource usage.12
The logic follows a state machine pattern:
Initialize VAD: An instance of webrtcvad.Vad is created with a configurable aggressiveness level (0-3). A level of 2 or 3 is recommended for filtering out most non-speech sounds.13
State: SILENT: The system starts in a silent state. It processes incoming audio frames but does not buffer them.
Transition to VOICED: If vad.is_speech() returns True for a certain number of consecutive frames (a "trigger-on" threshold), the state transitions to VOICED. The system begins appending the audio frames to a speech segment buffer.
State: VOICED: While in this state, all incoming frames are appended to the buffer.
Transition to SILENT: If vad.is_speech() returns False for a sustained period (e.g., 500-700 ms, a "trigger-off" threshold), the system assumes the utterance has ended. The collected speech segment buffer is then dispatched to the transcription worker's input queue. The state machine resets to SILENT, and the buffer is cleared.
This process ensures that only meaningful speech segments are sent for GPU-intensive processing, perfectly fulfilling the "minimalism by default" principle.
The following table specifies the critical, interdependent parameters for this audio pipeline. These values provide a robust baseline for development and should be user-configurable.

33


3.2. User Interaction and Control

A lifelong background application must provide flawless and intuitive user control. Instant Scribe achieves this through a dual-interface strategy: immediate access via a global hotkey and persistent control via a system tray icon. This layered approach ensures robustness; if one control method is unavailable (e.g., a hotkey conflict with another application), the user is not locked out.15

3.2.1. Global Hotkey Management with keyboard

The keyboard library is used to implement a system-wide hotkey for toggling the listening state of the application. It operates in its own thread, ensuring it remains responsive regardless of the main application's state.15

Python


# file: hotkey_manager.py
import keyboard
import logging

class HotkeyManager:
    def __init__(self, hotkey_string, callback):
        self.hotkey_string = hotkey_string
        self.callback = callback
        self.hotkey = None

    def start(self):
        """Registers the hotkey and starts listening."""
        try:
            self.hotkey = keyboard.add_hotkey(self.hotkey_string, self.callback)
            logging.info(f"Hotkey '{self.hotkey_string}' registered.")
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f"Failed to register hotkey: {e}")

    def stop(self):
        """Unregisters the hotkey."""
        if self.hotkey:
            keyboard.remove_hotkey(self.hotkey)
            logging.info(f"Hotkey '{self.hotkey_string}' unregistered.")


This manager will be instantiated in the main application thread, and its callback will toggle a shared, thread-safe state variable that the AudioListener checks before processing audio.

3.2.2. System Tray Integration with pystray

The pystray library provides the means for the application to live in the Windows system tray, making it unobtrusive yet always accessible.16 The main application thread will be dedicated to running the
pystray event loop.
The context menu is the primary interface for detailed control and will include:
A dynamic status indicator (e.g., "Status: Listening").
A "Toggle Listening" option that calls the same callback as the global hotkey.
An "Exit" option that gracefully shuts down the entire application.

Python


# file: main_app.py
from pystray import Icon, Menu, MenuItem
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw
import threading

# Global state (to be managed with thread-safe mechanisms)
app_state = {'is_listening': True, 'is_running': True}

def create_icon_image():
    # Placeholder for creating a PIL.Image object for the icon
    image = Image.new('RGB', (64, 64), 'black')
    return image

def on_toggle_listening(icon, item):
    app_state['is_listening'] = not app_state['is_listening']
    # Update menu item text dynamically
    icon.update_menu()

def on_exit(icon, item):
    app_state['is_running'] = False
    icon.stop()

def get_listening_status(item):
    return "Status: Listening" if app_state['is_listening'] else "Status: Idle"

def get_toggle_text(item):
    return "Stop Listening" if app_state['is_listening'] else "Start Listening"

# Menu items are defined as a tuple of MenuItem objects
menu = Menu(
    MenuItem(get_listening_status, None, enabled=False),
    Menu.SEPARATOR,
    MenuItem(get_toggle_text, on_toggle_listening),
    MenuItem('Exit', on_exit)
)

icon = Icon('Instant Scribe', create_icon_image(), 'Instant Scribe STT', menu)

# The icon must run in the main thread
icon.run()



3.2.3. User Feedback via Windows Notifications

To inform the user when a transcription is complete and ready, the application will use native Windows toast notifications. The windows-toasts library is selected for its modern implementation using WinRT.19
A NotificationManager class will abstract the notification logic. When the transcription worker process returns a result, it will be passed to this manager to be displayed.

Python


# file: notification_manager.py
from windows_toasts import Toast, WindowsToaster
import logging

class NotificationManager:
    def __init__(self, app_name="Instant Scribe"):
        self.toaster = WindowsToaster(app_name)

    def show_toast(self, title, message, on_activated_callback=None):
        """Displays a toast notification."""
        try:
            new_toast = Toast()
            new_toast.text_fields = [title, message]
            if on_activated_callback:
                new_toast.on_activated = on_activated_callback
            self.toaster.show_toast(new_toast)
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f"Failed to show toast notification: {e}")



Part IV: Robustness, Persistence, and Lifecycle Management

This section directly addresses the "robust" and "lifelong" requirements, detailing the strategies for handling configuration, managing state, recovering from errors, and ensuring the application operates continuously.

4.1. Configuration and State Management with JSON

To allow for user customization and to persist settings across application restarts, a simple and human-readable JSON file will be used. The built-in json module in Python is perfectly suited for this task.34
A ConfigManager class will handle all interactions with a config.json file stored in a standard user application data directory (e.g., %APPDATA%\Instant Scribe).
config.json Structure Example:

JSON


{
    "hotkey": "ctrl+alt+s",
    "vad_aggressiveness": 2,
    "silence_threshold_ms": 700,
    "show_notifications": true,
    "copy_to_clipboard_on_click": true
}


Implementation (ConfigManager):

Python


# file: config_manager.py
import json
import os
import logging

class ConfigManager:
    def __init__(self, app_name="Instant Scribe"):
        self.config_path = os.path.join(os.getenv('APPDATA'), app_name, 'config.json')
        self.defaults = {
            "hotkey": "ctrl+alt+s",
            "vad_aggressiveness": 2,
            "silence_threshold_ms": 700,
            "show_notifications": True,
            "copy_to_clipboard_on_click": True
        }
        self.settings = self.load_settings()

    def load_settings(self):
        """Loads settings from the JSON file, creating it with defaults if it doesn't exist."""
        try:
            os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(self.config_path), exist_ok=True)
            with open(self.config_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
                return json.load(f)
        except (FileNotFoundError, json.JSONDecodeError):
            logging.warning("Config file not found or invalid. Creating with default settings.")
            self.save_settings(self.defaults)
            return self.defaults

    def save_settings(self, settings_dict):
        """Saves the given settings dictionary to the JSON file."""
        try:
            with open(self.config_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
                json.dump(settings_dict, f, indent=4)
            self.settings = settings_dict
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f"Failed to save settings: {e}")


This approach not only handles user settings but can be extended for state persistence. For instance, a separate state.json file could be used to log the path of an audio segment being processed. If the application crashes, upon restart it could check this state file and offer to re-process the lost segment, directly enhancing robustness by leveraging the same persistence mechanism.36

4.2. Comprehensive Error Handling Strategy

A robust application must anticipate and gracefully handle failures at every level.
Global Unhandled Exception Hook: A top-level exception handler will be set using sys.excepthook. This acts as a final safety net. If any part of the application raises an exception that is not caught by a more specific handler, this hook will log the full traceback to a crash.log file and then attempt a graceful shutdown of all threads and processes.37
Targeted try...except Blocks: Specific, anticipated errors will be handled at the source:
Audio Errors: All calls to pyaudio will be wrapped to catch IOError, which can occur if a microphone is disconnected or its settings change.
Model/CUDA Errors: The transcribe() method call in the worker process will be wrapped to catch PyTorch and CUDA-specific exceptions, such as torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError. In such a case, the worker can log the error and notify the main process of the failure without crashing.
File System Errors: All file I/O operations (config, logging) will be wrapped to handle PermissionError and FileNotFoundError.39
Robust Logging: Python's built-in logging module will be configured to write timestamped logs to a file (app.log). This log will capture informational messages, warnings, and critical errors from all application components, providing an essential tool for debugging user-reported issues.

4.3. Crash Recovery and Lifelong Operation

To fulfill the "lifelong" requirement, the application must be able to recover from a catastrophic failure and automatically restart. A simple yet highly effective way to achieve this on Windows is the Watchdog Pattern.
This involves two separate scripts:
Instant Scribe.py: The main application script containing all the logic detailed in the previous sections.
watchdog.pyw: A minimal script whose sole responsibility is to launch and monitor Instant Scribe.py. The .pyw extension ensures it runs without a console window.
Watchdog Implementation:

Python


# file: watchdog.pyw
import subprocess
import sys
import time
import logging

# Configure logging for the watchdog itself
LOG_FILE = "watchdog.log"
logging.basicConfig(filename=LOG_FILE, level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(message)s')

def main():
    script_to_run = 'Instant Scribe.py'
    while True:
        logging.info(f"Starting {script_to_run}...")
        # Use sys.executable to ensure we use the same Python interpreter
        process = subprocess.Popen([sys.executable, script_to_run])
        process.wait()  # Wait for the process to terminate

        # If the process terminates, log it and restart after a delay
        logging.warning(f"{script_to_run} has terminated with exit code {process.returncode}. Restarting in 5 seconds...")
        time.sleep(5)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()


This pattern ensures that if the main application process crashes for any reason, the watchdog will detect the termination and relaunch it, creating a truly resilient and "lifelong" operational cycle.40 The installer (Part V) will be configured to place a shortcut to this
watchdog.pyw script in the Windows startup folder, ensuring the application launches automatically on system boot.

Part V: Packaging and Deployment for Windows 10

This final section provides the blueprint for packaging the Instant Scribe application and delivering it to end-users as a professional, self-contained, and easy-to-install Windows program.

5.1. Dependency Management and Verification

A reproducible build is essential for reliable deployment. This is achieved by creating a definitive list of all project dependencies with their exact versions.
The final requirements.txt file, generated from the development virtual environment using pip freeze, will serve as this manifest. It ensures that every build, whether by a developer or an automated CI/CD pipeline, uses the exact same set of libraries.
Final Dependency Manifest (requirements.txt):



# Core AI and Audio
nemo_toolkit[asr] # Use latest version for Parakeet v2
torch>=2.1.0+cu118
torchaudio>=2.1.0+cu118
# torchvision is not strictly required for ASR but often included with torch
pyaudio==0.2.14
webrtcvad-wheels==0.2.0.14

# System Dependencies (Handled by installer/setup script)
# - sox
# - ffmpeg
# - libsndfile

# UI and System Integration
pystray==0.19.0
Pillow==10.1.0
keyboard==0.13.5
windows-toasts==1.3.1

# Other essential dependencies pulled by the above
numpy==1.26.2
... (and so on for all transitive dependencies)



5.2. Creating a Standalone Executable with PyInstaller

PyInstaller is the tool used to bundle the Python scripts, dependencies, and critical data files (like the ASR model) into a distributable package.21 Using a
.spec file is mandatory for this project due to the need to include non-code assets.

5.2.1. Advanced .spec File Configuration

The build process begins by generating a template spec file, which is then heavily customized.
Generate Spec File:
pyi-makespec --noconsole --name Instant Scribe watchdog.pyw
The --noconsole flag is critical for a background application to prevent a console window from appearing.41 We target the
watchdog.pyw as the entry point.
Customize Instant Scribe.spec:
The most important modification is to the datas argument within the Analysis block. This tells PyInstaller to find the Parakeet model files in the local NeMo cache and bundle them into the application.23
Python
# Instant Scribe.spec

# This helper function locates the NeMo model cache
def get_nemo_model_path(model_name):
    import os
    from appdirs import user_cache_dir
    # NeMo caches models in the user's cache directory
    cache_dir = user_cache_dir('torch', 'NVIDIA')
    model_path = os.path.join(cache_dir, 'NeMo', 'models', model_name)
    if os.path.exists(model_path):
        return model_path
    raise FileNotFoundError(f"Could not find cached NeMo model: {model_name}")

# Find the path to the Parakeet model
parakeet_model_path = get_nemo_model_path('Parakeet-TDT-0.6B-v2')

a = Analysis(
    ['watchdog.pyw'],
    pathex=,
    binaries=,
    # Bundle the entire model directory and other assets
    datas=,
    hiddenimports=['pystray._win32'], # Example of handling hidden imports
    hookspath=,
    runtime_hooks=,
    excludes=,
    win_no_prefer_redirects=False,
    win_private_assemblies=False,
    cipher=None,
    noarchive=False,
)
pyz = PYZ(a.pure, a.zipped_data, cipher=None)

exe = EXE(
    pyz,
    a.scripts,
    a.binaries,
    a.zipfiles,
    a.datas,
   ,
    name='Instant Scribe',
    debug=False,
    bootloader_ignore_signals=False,
    strip=False,
    upx=True,
    upx_exclude=,
    runtime_tmpdir=None,
    console=False, # Set to False for a GUI/tray app
    icon='path/to/icon.ico',
)



5.2.2. Accessing Bundled Data at Runtime

To reliably access the bundled model and icon files, a helper function is required in the Python code. This function checks if the application is running in a "frozen" state (i.e., packaged by PyInstaller) and constructs the correct path to the resource.23

Python


# file: resource_manager.py
import sys
import os

def resource_path(relative_path):
    """ Get absolute path to resource, works for dev and for PyInstaller """
    try:
        # PyInstaller creates a temp folder and stores path in _MEIPASS
        base_path = sys._MEIPASS
    except Exception:
        base_path = os.path.abspath(".")

    return os.path.join(base_path, relative_path)

# Usage in the application:
# model_path = resource_path('nemo_models/Parakeet-TDT-0.6B-v2')
# icon_path = resource_path('icon.ico')



5.2.3. Building the Executable

With the spec file configured, the final build command is simple:
pyinstaller Instant Scribe.spec
This will generate a dist/Instant Scribe folder containing the main executable and all its dependencies, ready for the final installation step.

5.3. Building a User-Friendly Installer with Pynsist

While PyInstaller creates the application bundle, it does not create a true Windows installer. A proper installer provides a professional user experience, handling installation directories, Start Menu shortcuts, and uninstallation. Pynsist is a tool that uses the robust NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System) to create such an installer from a Python project.24

5.3.1. Creating the installer.cfg

Pynsist is configured via a simple installer.cfg file.

Ini, TOML


# file: installer.cfg

[Application]
name=Instant Scribe
version=1.0.0
# The entry point is the watchdog script
entry_point=watchdog:main
icon=assets/icon.ico

[Python]
# Pynsist will download and bundle this specific version of Python
version=3.10.11
bitness=64

[Include]
# List all packages required by the application
# Use the latest compatible versions resolved by pip-compile
pypi_wheels =
    nemo_toolkit[asr]
    torch
    torchaudio
    pyaudio==0.2.14
    webrtcvad-wheels==0.2.0.14
    pystray==0.19.0
    Pillow==10.1.0

# Include the entire application directory created by PyInstaller
files =
    dist/Instant Scribe/



5.3.2. Building the Final Installer

The final step is to run pynsist with the configuration file:
pynsist installer.cfg
This command orchestrates the entire process:
Downloads the specified 64-bit Python embeddable distribution.
Creates a new virtual environment.
Installs all the specified pypi_wheels into it.
Copies the application files from the dist/Instant Scribe directory.
Generates an NSIS script (.nsi).
Compiles the script into a single Instant Scribe_1.0.0_x64.exe installer file.
This final executable provides the end-user with a familiar, professional installation experience, handling all necessary setup steps, including placing a shortcut in the Start Menu that can be pinned to the startup folder for "lifelong" operation.

Part VI: Conclusion

This document has laid out a comprehensive and meticulous blueprint for the development of Instant Scribe, a minimalist, robust, and lifelong speech-to-text application for Windows 10. By adhering to the specified architecture, technology stack, and implementation guidelines, the development team can construct a high-performance application that meets all project objectives.
The architectural foundation rests on the principles of minimalism by default, local-first processing, and robustness through modularity. The selection of NVIDIA's Parakeet TDT 0.6B-v2 model, powered by the NVIDIA NeMo Toolkit, provides a state-of-the-art transcription core that balances exceptional accuracy with resource efficiency suitable for a desktop environment. The strategic use of a Voice Activity Detection (VAD) gate is the key innovation that enables the application to remain dormant and resource-free until speech is detected, fulfilling the "minimalist" and "lifelong" requirements.
The implementation plan provides clear, actionable steps for each component, from real-time audio capture with PyAudio and VAD with webrtcvad, to user control via keyboard and pystray. The multi-process design, which isolates the AI model in a separate worker process managed by a watchdog script, ensures a high degree of resilience against crashes.
Finally, the deployment strategy, utilizing a combination of PyInstaller for application bundling and Pynsist for creating a professional Windows installer, ensures a polished and reliable distribution process for end-users. By following this guide, the development team is equipped with a single source of truth to build Instant Scribe efficiently and without ambiguity, resulting in a powerful, private, and perpetually available transcription tool for Windows 10 users.
