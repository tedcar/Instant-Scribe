The idea is for an extremely simplistic app, built using technologies that are very well known, have been around for a very long time, and are very stable. Once created, it should work with Windows for as long as Windows exists. It would be designed to last a lifetime on a Windows 10 system.

A new speech-to-text model, the NVIDIA Parakeet TDT 0.6B-B2, is the core of this concept. It's a 600 million parameter automatic speech recognition (ASR) model designed for high-quality English transcription, featuring support for punctuation, capitalization, and accurate time-stamp prediction. It's an extremely fast transcription model, and at only 0.6 billion parameters, it should run without problems on an NVIDIA GPU.

The app would leverage this AI model. It is designed to start as soon as Windows starts and automatically load the model into the VRAM of an NVIDIA RTX 3080, running entirely on the GPU, not the CPU. A key feature is that the transcription output would not include timestamps.

The motivation behind this app is to streamline the voice-to-text process. Current online transcription services can be cumbersome, requiring multiple clicks, VPNs in certain regions, and a waiting period for the transcription to complete. Long recordings can take a significant amount of time and are sometimes prone to errors that force a restart. After a successful transcription, the text must then be manually copied to the clipboard. This app aims to eliminate these steps for a seamless experience. The NVIDIA AI model is so fast it can transcribe one-hour recordings in under a second, meaning text should be available almost instantaneously.

The user experience would be as easy as possible. The app would have full elevated access over the PC and always have the AI model loaded into the VRAM of the NVIDIA graphics card. Since the model is small, it would take up minimal VRAM, perhaps around 1 gigabyte in a worst-case scenario. A separate shortcut or a tray icon option would exist to unload the model from VRAM, freeing up resources for graphically intensive tasks like gaming.

The main feature revolves around a shortcut: Control+Alt+F. The app would always run in the background from the system tray. When Control+Alt+F is pressed, a brief notification would appear, indicating that recording has started. The recording can continue for any length of time, even for an hour or more.

To stop the recording, the same shortcut, Control+Alt+F, is used. This stops the recording and begins the transcription process. The transcription should have absolutely no timestamps. Most use cases for speech-to-text don't require them, and they are often just a waste of tokens.

Once the transcription is complete, the text would be automatically sent to the clipboard. The app will not have any UI; its primary inputs are the Control+Alt+F shortcut and a couple of notifications.

A significant portion of the design effort would focus on the recording session's robustness. The chance of losing a recording should be virtually zero. One idea is for the app to make a temporary save of the recording every minute. These parts would be merged at the end. This way, if a catastrophic failure occurs, at most only the last minute of the recording would be lost. The app should be designed to never lose a recording, even if the PC completely shuts off due to a power failure or if the system goes to sleep. In such events, the recording should be paused, not stopped. Upon restarting or logging back into Windows, a notification with a "yes" or "no" option would ask to continue the last abruptly stopped recording. Clicking "yes" would resume the recording seamlessly.

A dedicated pause function is also a key feature. Control+Alt+F will always be for starting or stopping. To pause a recording, the shortcut would be Control+Alt+C. This would show a notification that the recording has been paused. Pressing Control+Alt+C again would continue the recording.

The app should be as fast as possible. The model itself is not CPU-intensive as it runs on the GPU. The final product would be a .exe file that, when first run, would handle its own setup. The app should be robust and not fragile. If a dependency like a CUDA driver gets deleted, the app should be smart enough to try and install the missing dependencies on its own, using its administrative access. It should handle this seamlessly without user intervention. The goal is to spend time using the app, not fixing it.

The app would also be intelligent about silence. If no speech is detected for a couple of minutes, it might send a notification, but it will not stop the recording. Before sending the audio for transcription, the app will identify and remove long periods of silence from the recording, editing the saved batch files to create a speech-only audio stream. It's okay if some minor silences remain. The app will use the default microphone selected in the Windows Control Panel.

To make the transcription feel instantaneous even for very long recordings, a batching system would be used. Every ten minutes of recorded audio would be sent to the Parakeet model to be transcribed in the background. When the user finally presses Control+Alt+F to stop, only the last portion of the recording needs to be transcribed. All the transcribed batches are then merged and sent to the clipboard.

All recordings and transcriptions will be saved permanently in a specific folder. The app will create a new subfolder for each session. The folder name will be a number (e.g., "1_", "2_", etc., for chronological organization) followed by the date and time of the recording. Inside this folder, there will be two files: the audio file, simply named "Recording," and the text file containing the full transcription.

The app must be robust in sending text to the clipboard, as the Windows clipboard can sometimes be unreliable. Even if it's billions of characters long, the transcription should never fail to copy. As a failsafe, in case the clipboard is cleared or fails, the transcription.txt file is created in the session folder. The name of this .txt file will be the first seven words of the transcription itself. This makes it easy to go into the main folder, find the session by date, and identify the correct transcription file by its content-descriptive name, ensuring the text is never lost.
